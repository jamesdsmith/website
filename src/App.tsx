          My research broadly examines how emerging technologies give rise to new forms of media and the unique
          affordances these mediums offer. I am particularly interested in exploring how these technologies can foster
          new modes of interactivity and enhance human creativity.

        <p className="mt-2">
          My dissertation work explores the sense of presence and embodiment in computer systems, focusing on how
          digital tools can feel like extensions of our bodies, particularly in <strong>Virtual Reality</strong>{" "}
          interfaces. I study multi-body VR interfaces that allow users to extend their body schema into multiple bodies
          and perform coordinated tasks, connecting theories from Human-Computer Interaction, Embodied Cognition, and
          Phenomenology.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Lately I have been interested in what new types of media <strong>Generative AI</strong> can enable. I have
          explored Large Lanuage Models as a co-creator of interactive experiences, and new ways for artists to express
          their intent with diffusion models.
